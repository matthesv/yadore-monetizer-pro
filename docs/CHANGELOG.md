# Changelog

## 3.47.10 - 2025-10-11
- Added `box-sizing: border-box` and enforced full-width layout on `.yadore-admin-wrap` to keep new inline paddings inside the viewport and preserve equal gutters for hero/meta cards down to 400â€¯px.
- Rebuilt admin CSS/JS bundles so dashboards immediately consume the refreshed spacing tokens for this release.

## 3.47.9 - 2025-10-10
- Adjusted the hero meta grid to clamp card column widths on narrow viewports, keeping dashboard cards consistent on mobile.
- Updated bundled assets to report version 3.47.9 across the admin UI resources.

## 3.47.8 - 2025-10-09
- Added the `.yadore-card-grid` utility class with shared CSS variables for spacing, padding, and responsive minimum widths.
- Refactored admin templates to adopt the shared grid utility and ensure consistent card layouts across dashboard, analytics, scanner, debug, tools, and settings pages.
- Verified responsive behaviour for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints to keep card alignments stable regardless of content.
